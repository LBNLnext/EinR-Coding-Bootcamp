# Experiences in Research Coding Bootcamp

## Introduction

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for Berkeley Lab K-12 STEM Education & Outreach Programs Experiences in Research (EinR) Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this coding bootcamp is to help prepare interns to successfully work on coding-based projects. The coding bootcamp will be in Python and utilize Jupyter notebooks. The following topics will be covered:

- NumPy Arrays
- Matplotlib Data Visualization
- Machine Learning: Regression, Classification

There are optional pre-work notebooks for students who need an introduction or refresher on the following topics:

- Jupyter notebook basics
- Data types
- Variables
- Functions
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Conditionals
- Loops

Lesson materials for other parts of the bootcamp (data analysis / visualization using spreadsheets and scripting) are shared in a shared Google folder with interns.

## Running Jupyter Notebooks

First, you need to download the coding bootcamp materials from this repository:

1. Click the green "Code" button on the top right of the repository information page.
2. Click "Download Zip". Extract the file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (such as your Desktop).

You can run the notebooks in multiple ways:

### 1. Locally through Anaconda

You can run Python and Jupyter notebooks on your computer through Anaconda. Anaconda is an open-source (free!) Python distribution platform.

Click here to download [Anaconda Distribution (Python 3.12, 64-Bit Graphical Installer)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Make sure you are downloading the correct version for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux). Once you have installed Anaconda:

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application (note that it might take a few minutes to load up when you launch the application the first time).
2. Click the 'Launch' button under 'Jupyter Notebook' (NOT JupyterLab) and then navigate through your file system to the `EinR-Coding-Bootcamp` folder you just downloaded.
3. Go to the notebooks folder and open a notebook to test. You don't have to run anything for now. Just make sure that you can open the notebook successfully!

We recommend students to run notebooks locally on their computers by downloading Anaconda, but Anaconda now has a new feature where you can run notebooks in the cloud - [you can access this feature here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/notebooks). Note that interface uses JupyterLab, which is pretty similar but different to Jupyter Notebooks. Keep in mind that you still have to download the coding bootcamp materials from this repository, then upload it to the cloud.

### 2. Binder

In case Anaconda isn't working, an alternative option is to run the Jupyter notebooks in the cloud through binder. Just keep in mind that your work is **not** saved in binder.

### 3. In the cloud with Google Colab

If you have a Google account, you should have access to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You will still need to download the coding bootcamp materials and then upload it to your drive.

*Note that this may not easily work for notebook 04_data-visualization as you will have to make sure each path to read in the data files are correct.*
