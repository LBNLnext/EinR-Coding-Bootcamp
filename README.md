# Experiences in Research Coding Bootcamp

## Introduction

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for Berkeley Lab K-12 STEM Education & Outreach Programs' Experiences in Research (EinR) Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this coding bootcamp is to help prepare interns to successfully work on coding-based projects. The coding bootcamp will be in Python and utilize Jupyter notebooks. The following topics will be covered:
- Jupyter notebook basics
- Data types
- Variables
- Functions
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Conditionals
- Loops
- NumPy Arrays
- Matplotlib Data Visualization

## Installing Anaconda

The easiest way to run Python and Jupyter notebooks on your computer is through Anaconda. Anaconda is an open-source (free!) Python distribution platform.

Click here to download [Anaconda Distribution (Python 3.9, 64-Bit Graphical Installer)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Make sure you are downloading the correct version for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

## Running Jupyter Notebooks

First, you need to download the coding bootcamp materials from this repository:

1. Click the green "Code" button on the top right of the repository information page.
2. Click "Download Zip". Extract the file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (such as your Desktop).

Then, you will use the Anaconda Navigator application that you just installed to open the notebooks:

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application (note that it might take a few minutes to load up when you launch the application the first time).
2. Click the 'Launch' button under 'Jupyter Notebook' (NOT JupyterLab) and then navigate through your file system to the `EinR-Coding-Bootcamp` folder you just downloaded.
3. Go to the notebooks folder and open `00_intro_to_python.ipynb` to begin. You don't have to run anything for now - this will be the first notebook we will use during the coding bootcamp. Just make sure that you can open the notebook successfully!

## Alternative to Anaconda

In case Anaconda isn't working, an alternative option is to run the Jupyter notebooks in the cloud through binder. Just keep in mind that your work is not saved in binder.
